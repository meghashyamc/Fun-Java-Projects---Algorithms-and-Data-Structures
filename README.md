# Fun Projects as Part of Algorithms 1 on Coursera
Worked on these as part of the course 'Algorithms 1' (Princeton University) on Coursera.

All the programs here require various classes from <a href = "https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/algs4.jar"> algs4.jar</a>. This is because stacks, queues, trees and almost every data structure used in the course are the ones implemented by the professors and the not the ones from Java utilities.

The project description for each project is there in the README file in the project's folder.
