The detailed project description for this project can be found here:

https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/collinear/specification.php

The summarized description is:

Given a set of n distinct points in the plane, find every (maximal) line segment that connects a subset of 4 or more of the points.
 
 BruteCollinearPoints.java uses a brute-force method (O(n^4) time) to find out if four points are collinear.
 FastCollinearPoints.java uses sorting with a special slope-order comparator to find all line segments with 4 or more points in O (n^2 x log (n)) time.
 LineSegment.java was provided as part of the project description.
